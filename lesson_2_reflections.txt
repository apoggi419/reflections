What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository indicates to Git that the contents in this directory will be used for that repository. Without initialization, Git commands will not be available. 

How is the staging are different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area that lets you determine which files you want to commit in your repository so that you can choose which files to ommit in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add files to be commited when you have completed one logical change.
